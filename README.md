# Multiobjective Subspace Feature Optimization based Subspace Clustering

The developed method is an evolutionary based subspce clustering aproach where it also considers the optimization of relevant subspace features.

# Motivation

Subspace clustering technique divides the data set into different groups or clusters where each cluster comprises of objects that share some similar properties.
The distance-based separation between two clusters may not be useful in the context of subspace clustering, as the clusters may belong to two different subspaces.
Moreover, in the case of subspace clustering, the selection of relevant subspace features plays a primary role in generating good quality subspace clusters and the optimization of the selection of subspace feature is necessary.

# SOSubClust

The proposed approach optimizes the subspace features by considering two new objective functions, feature non-redundancy(FNR) and feature per cluster(FPC) represented in the form of PSM-index. Another objective function, intra-cluster compactness (ICC-index), is modified and used to optimize the compactness among objects within the cluster. Finally, an evolutionary-based multi-objective subspace clustering technique is developed in this paper optimizing these validity indices. A new mutation operator, namely duplication and deletion along with the modified version of the exogenous genetic material uptake, are developed to explore the search space effectively.
